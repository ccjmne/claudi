# My first Blog Post

Published on: 2025-03-12

Welcome to my very first blog post! I'm so excited to start this journey with you all. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
